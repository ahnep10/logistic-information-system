# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-29)

**Core value:** Give managers a single real-time source of truth for inventory and procurement so they can make faster, data-driven decisions, reduce stock shortages, and improve operational efficiency.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Plan: 2 of 6

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack selected: Next.js 15 + PostgreSQL 16 + Prisma 6 + Auth.js v5 + shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Recharts + xlsx (SheetJS)
- Architecture: three-layer monolith — presentation / application (Server Actions) / data (Prisma)
- Inventory is the single writer of stock quantities; PO goods-receipt must call the inventory service atomically
- All stock mutations must use DB transactions with SELECT FOR UPDATE + CHECK constraint (qty >= 0)
- [Phase ?]: Auth.js v5 two-file split (auth.config.ts Edge-safe + lib/auth.ts Node.js only) required for Next.js 15 middleware
- [Phase ?]: shadcn/ui v4 (base-nova style, @base-ui/react) used — v3 new-york style deprecated; form.tsx created manually as @radix-ui not available
- [Phase ?]: zod@4.x and @hookform/resolvers@5.x accepted (npm latest); Zod 4 API backward compatible for all loginSchema/createUserSchema usage patterns

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Verify Auth.js v5 latest stable release before pinning in Phase 1
- Verify exact Prisma 6 interactive transaction syntax before Phase 3 coding begins
- Verify Prisma 6 SELECT FOR UPDATE pattern before Phase 3 coding begins
- Verify xlsx (SheetJS) current stable version on npm before Phase 6 installation
